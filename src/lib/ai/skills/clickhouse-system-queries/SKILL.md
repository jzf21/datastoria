# ClickHouse System Queries Skill

Use this skill when the user asks for operational inspection on ClickHouse `system.*` tables.

Current table coverage:

- `system.query_log` via `references/system-query-log.md`

Relationship to `sql-expert`:

- `sql-expert` handles general SQL generation and user/business tables.
- This skill handles system-table operational patterns and routing to table-specific references.

## System Metrics and ProfileEvents

- For metric-style columns in system tables, first confirm the actual column shape from schema/reference before writing predicates.
- If `ProfileEvents` is a `Map`, access entries as `ProfileEvents['Name']`.
- If the table exposes flattened columns, use `ProfileEvent_Name`.
- Apply the same rule to other metric maps or flattened event columns: use the representation that exists in the target table, not the one you assume.

## Workflow

1. Resolve target system table and intent.
   - Identify whether the request is about query history (`system.query_log`) or other system tables.
   - If user does not provide a new time window, inherit the most recent explicit time window/range from conversation.
   - If no prior explicit time context exists, default to the last 60 minutes.

2. Load the matching reference and follow it strictly.
   - `system.query_log` -> `references/system-query-log.md`
   - For unsupported system tables, use `sql-expert` for safe fallback SQL generation.

3. Execute with `execute_sql`.
   - Default to `LIMIT 50` unless the user specifies otherwise.
   - Keep predicates aligned with intent and table semantics.

4. Summarize with concise findings and next actions.

## Guardrails

- Always apply time bounds for log-like system tables.
- Always use the table-specific reference when available.
- Never omit `LIMIT` in exploratory queries.
